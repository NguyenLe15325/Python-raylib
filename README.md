## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system
- **raylib Python binding** — Install via pip:

```bash
pip install raylib-py
```

> **Note:** If you use a different binding or version (e.g., `raylib-python-cffi`), adjust the import statements accordingly.

### Running a Demo

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NguyenLe15325/Python-raylib.git
   cd Python-raylib
   ```

2. **Run one of the demos:**
   ```bash
   python 3.Pong.py
   ```

3. **Explore, modify, and experiment!**
   - Change colors, speeds, or physics parameters
   - Add new features or mechanics
   - Build your own game using these as templates

## 🎯 Suggested Learning Path

Follow this progression to get the most out of these demos:

**1. 🟢 Start with basics** (`1.ball.py`)  
↓ *Understand the game loop and rendering*

**2. 🟡 Add input** (`3.Pong.py`, `4.Pong_2player.py`)  
↓ *Progress to input-driven games*

**3. 🟠 Explore platformers** (`10.2D_platformer_camera.py`)  
↓ *Learn camera control and advanced 2D mechanics*

**4. 🔴 Try 3D** (`16.Basic_3D.py`)  
↓ *Dive into 3D scenes and rendering*

**5. 🟣 Physics** (`19.Physics_playground.py`, `20.Physics_simulation.py`)  
↓ *Experiment with physics simulations*

**6. ⚫ Build your own!**  
*Extend a demo: add new mechanics, change assets, or create something original!*
